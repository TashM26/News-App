<h1 align = "center"> News App </h1>

  I present to you a news application with the ability to localize into three languages: Russian, Uzbek and English. This application receives news data from the uzreport resource, which allows users to keep abreast of the latest events in Uzbekistan and in the world.

  To implement localization and multilingual support, we use the intl, l10n, Provider, Http and Rss libraries. The intl library helps us with translating the application's text elements into different languages. The l10n library allows you to manage localization and translations in your application, providing flexibility and convenience for users.

  The Provider library is used to manage application state and pass data between different widgets. It helps us efficiently manage news information and provide it to users in the language they need.

  The Http library is used to make requests to the uzreport web server and receive up-to-date news data. With this library, we can get the latest news and update it in real time in the app.

  Finally, the Rss library allows you to process news data in the RSS (Really Simple Syndication) format. It allows us to receive structured information about the news, such as headlines, texts and images, and present them to the user in a convenient and understandable format.
As a result, our news application provides a wide range of users with access to up-to-date news in several languages, facilitating the process of obtaining information and maintaining links with the external resource uzreport for news updates.
